Nathan Bol - Earth Analytics Bootcamp Final Project - Grassland Management under Climate Change

This project seeks to create a model of climate suitability for the North American native Sorghastrum nutans, a grass whose range is moving northward with the changing climate.

Variables analyzed will include a measure of soil suitability, topographical suitability, and projected precipitation.

The code runs sequentially. Ensure that the Xarray-Spatial library is installed and imported prior to running.

The code outputs a number of plots showing the suitability for S. Nutans within the bounds of regions of three National Grasslands, Crooked River in OR, and Little Missouri and Sheyenne both in North Dakota. There is also a plot showing the change in suitability between 2010 historical precipitation and 2060 projected precipitation while all other variable are held constant.
